const row = ...;
-This code creates a new row of HTML code to be added to the debt items table. The row consists of four columns - the name of the debt, the amount owed, a "Mark as Paid" button, and a "Delete" button.

const element = event.target;
-This line gets the HTML element that triggered the click event and assigns it to the element constant.

const parent = element.parentNode.parentNode;
-This line gets the parent of the element's parent node, which is the row in which the button was clicked, and assigns it to the parent constant.

if (element.classList.contains('status-btn')) { ... }
-This code checks if the clicked button has the class status-btn, which indicates that the button is the "Mark as Paid" button. If it is, the debt item is marked as paid by adding the paid class to the row, disabling the "Mark as Paid" button, and changing its text to "Paid".

} else if (element.classList.contains('delete-btn')) { ... }
-This code checks if the clicked button has the class delete-btn, which indicates that the button is the "Delete" button. If it is, the entire row containing the debt item is removed from the table.
